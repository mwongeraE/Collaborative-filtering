# Collaborative-filtering
Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users.  It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. It looks at the items they like and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions.
